# Survey Form
This is my recreation of the Survey Form project from freecodecamp
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP

## Problems
I had problems with compatibility of the background with different browsers, as well as getting the page to scale properly on devices of different sizes

## What I learned
I learned about how to use HTML form elements, background gradients, different input types, and scaling to different sized viewports
