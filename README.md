# Survey Form
This is my recreation of the Survey Form project from freecodecamp
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP

## Problems
I had to create a form using different input types, label options correctly, and style the page and align items correctly. I also had to figure out how to make the page scale appropriately on differently sized devices

## What I used
HTML, CSS, meta viewport tag

## What I learned
I learned about how to use HTML form elements, background gradients, different input types, and scaling to different sized viewports
